        <h2>Site Name</h2>
        <p>The site name that I choosed is The Greastest Chamber of Commerce.</p>
        <h2>Site Porpuse</h2>
        <p>
            The purpose of the greatestchambercamera.com is to inform the various local businesses about how the chamber of commerce can help them grow as a company and connect with other companies, this will be reflected on the main page where they will also have some relevant news of the week. 
            <br>
            Likewise, the greatestchambercamera.com will help them find businesses nearby with which they can contact, and they will also be able to have a user account with which they will access more information within the website. All this will serve to encourage the client and solve their concerns so that they can join our chamber camera and work hand in hand in the growth process.
        </p>
